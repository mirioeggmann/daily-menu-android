# Daily Meal Plan

Just a little project to get into retrofit2, okhttp3 and some basic android stuff.

The idea of the project is that you basically can access all daily menus...

Currently it's only possible to get the menu of the current day in the [Restaurant Engehalde](http://restaurant-engehalde.sv-restaurant.ch/). 

I use the following api to get the menus of the sv-restaurants: [svmeal-api](https://github.com/jmesserli/svmeal-api)
